    "desc": "A crucial component of achieving Trustworthy AI is transparency which encompasses three elements: 1) traceability, 2) explainability and 3) open communication about the limitations of the AI system. Technical robustness requires that AI systems be developed with a preventative approach to risks and in a manner such that they reliably behave as intended while minimising unintentional and unexpected harm, and preventing unacceptable harm. This should also apply to potential changes in their operating environment or the presence of other agents (human and artificial) that may interact with the system in an adversarial manner. In addition, the physical and mental integrity of humans should be ensured.",

The questions in this subsection focus on the ability of the AI system to explain both how it works and why it makes the decisions it does. It's important for AI systems to be able to explain themselves because this helps people trust them. When an AI system makes a decision, it should be able to explain why it made that decision, if possible. If it's not possible to explain why a decision was made, the system is considered a \"black box\" and requires special attention. In these cases, other ways of making the system more explainable, such as by making it easy to track its decisions or by being transparent about its capabilities, may be necessary. The amount of explainability needed depends on the situation and how serious the consequences could be if the AI system makes a mistake.",
